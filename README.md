# Hi, I’m Gabriel Jobert

- I’m interested in many things but on this account, my focus will be on Machine Learning and AI.
- I am currently doing a Msc in Data Science at HEC Montreal, Canada. Before starting this master's degree, my background was more business-oriented, with a B.A.A. obtained in 2022 and an 8-month professional experience as a BI developer at Kruger Inc between both degrees.
- Here is my website for more information or way to contact me : https://dandelion-line-25d.notion.site/Gabriel-Jobert-e9e97ad69d4d4a509696979b0fe62b68?pvs=4
